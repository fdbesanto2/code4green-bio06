This repository contains code and data used during the hackathon Code4Green by the team Bio06 (initial team name).

The directory **study_case** contains the spatial data and the code used to generate the [html report](https://rpubs.com/valentin/study-case) presented in Devpost for evaluation.

The directory **sandbox** was used only for testing ideas, minimal examples, exploratory stuff.
