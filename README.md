This repository contains code and data used during the hackathon Code4Green by the team team_cli07_landscapeoptimizer (initial team name - Bio06).

The directory **study_case** contains the spatial data and the code used to generate the [html report](https://rpubs.com/valentin/study-case) presented in Devpost for evaluation.

The directory **app_shiny_bio06** contains code and data for running online a simple interactive dashboard hosted on a Shiny server - [here: app_shiny_bio06](https://valentin-stefan.shinyapps.io/app_shiny_bio06/). Be patient, the hosting service is for free and therefore, a bit slower :) 
The dashboard is in a minimalistic form, but currently acts as a proof of concept as also illustrated through the [study_case report](https://rpubs.com/valentin/study-case). The user would input data about her/his crops and then after clicking on “Calculate”, gets some graphs about landscape diversity metrics.

The directory **sandbox** was used only for testing ideas, minimal examples, exploratory stuff.
